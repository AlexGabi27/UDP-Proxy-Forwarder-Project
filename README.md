# UDP Proxy Forwarder Project
 
Project Description:

This project entails the development of a forwarding program designed to facilitate communication between a client and a server within a gaming context. The program, written in C/C++, aims to intercept, process, and relay messages and data packets between a game client and its corresponding game server, ensuring seamless gameplay experience.

Key aspects of the project include the establishment of a robust and secure connection channel, efficient packet handling, and minimal latency to provide real-time interaction capabilities. The forwarder will serve as a middleware that not only relays information but also integrates additional functionalities provided by the Steamworks SDK.
